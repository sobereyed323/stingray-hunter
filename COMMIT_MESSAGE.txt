Major update: Add triangulation, AI hunting, and direction finding

Features added:
- GPS-based triangulation for tower location estimation
- AI-powered threat assessment and hunting guidance
- Interactive Google Maps interface for planning scans
- Dual-HackRF direction finding with bearing calculation
- Enhanced detection and detailed reporting

New commands:
- scan-locate: GPS-tagged scanning for triangulation
- triangulate: Calculate tower location from multiple measurements
- ai-hunt: AI-guided hunting with optimal scan point recommendations
- df-scan: Direction finding to get compass bearing to tower
- df-calibrate: Calibrate DF system with known signals
- detailed-report: Comprehensive tower analysis

New modules:
- stingray_hunter/gps.py: GPS coordinate handling and distance calculations
- stingray_hunter/triangulate.py: Trilateration algorithm
- stingray_hunter/ai_analyzer.py: Intelligent threat assessment
- stingray_hunter/direction_finding.py: Phase difference analysis and bearing calculation
- stingray_hunter/dual_receiver.py: Dual HackRF coordination

Documentation:
- MAP_GUIDE.md: Google Maps integration guide
- DF_ANTENNA_GUIDE.md: Direction finding antenna setup
- DUAL_HACKRF_GUIDE.md: Creative dual-SDR use cases
- Updated tower_db.py with location_measurements table

Bug fixes:
- Improved device enumeration for dual HackRF detection
- Fixed scanner to properly detect towers (now finds 25+ towers)
- Lowered detection threshold for better sensitivity
